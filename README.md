#Human Resource System 

Problem Statement

Most companies and organisations face a challenge of the current Human Resource operations are hindered by fragmented, manual processes and a heavy reliance on physical documentation and disjointed spreadsheets. This "paper-silo" environment leads to significant data latency, high rates of clerical error in payroll and attendance, and a lack of real-time visibility into employee performance and organizational health. HR staff spend over 60% of their time on repetitive administrative tasks rather than strategic talent development, directly impacting the company's bottom line and employee morale.


The Automated Human Resource System provides the following solutions.

    1.Bio-Data Database: A single source of truth where an update in an employee's role automatically reflects in payroll and reporting lines.

    2.Self-Service Portals: Empowering employees to request leave and update personal info, shifting the data entry burden away from HR.

    3.Automated Payroll Engine: Using predefined logic to calculate net pay, URA taxes, and deductions based on attendance data.

    4.Digital Policy Repository: A centralized, searchable module for organizational policies to ensure transparency.

    5.Performance Analytics: Transitioning from "gut-feeling" appraisals to data-driven performance metrics based on assigned work tasks.
